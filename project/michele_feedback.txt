Good job figuring out how to make the alarm clock function of the app. It works fine, but only because I know exactly what format to enter my time into the text box on the home screen. My suggestion for the UI is to tell me what format I need to enter the time as so that the alarm clock works - make a label that says “Enter the time in the format HH:MM” so that it doesn’t throw an error. The sound of the alarm is absolutely terrifying, though… One other suggestion is to somehow remind the user that the alarm is set - include a label that changes to “alarm set!” or something when I press “set alarm.” That way the user will get the feedback they need to know whether they are using the app correctly or not. Good job with the app in general.
