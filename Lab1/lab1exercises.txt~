1. A) In the terminal I typed: 
	python manage.py syncdb
	python manage.py runserver
I went to the server: localhost:8000/movies

B)The URL in the browser is: http://localhost:8000/movies/1/
  The URL in the browser is: http://localhost:8000/movies/2/
  The 100th URL would be: http://localhost:8000/movies/100

C) The function that would get called is def add_movie
If you typed http://127.0.0.1:8000/shrek it would return it won't work because there is no reference to it in urls.py
